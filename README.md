# Nathan Pitman Fireworks Extensions

This is a source code mirror for Nathan Pitman's Fireworks extensions.

He released them [in his blog](http://nathanpitman.com/610/source-code-for-my-fireworks-extensions) and even though I don't have any immediate plan for them, I thought it would be nice to have them in a Git repository, just in case :)
